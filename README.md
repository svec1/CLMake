CLMAKE is a build system that is an unfinished project, with not very good code and with terrible performance due to the latest update (multi-threaded helper).
This assembly system will not be updated soon (although there is a chance that it will be if there are helpers*).
The build system is called one story, and it is in no way connected with Make, although it is connected with the Clang compiler as the main compiler for assembly.
